This error occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncStorage` hook in conjunction with a component that unmounts prematurely before the asynchronous operation completes.  This might happen when navigating quickly between screens or dismissing a modal unexpectedly. The hook throws an error because it attempts to access and update state after the component has been unmounted.  This leads to a warning like `Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.` or similar, potentially crashing your app.
